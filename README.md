# Jetpack Compose Login UI

**Find My Bus** is a user-friendly Android application developed to simplify public bus travel by offering accurate, real-time, and essential information to commuters. It addresses the lack of a centralized system for government bus details and eliminates the uncertainty and inconvenience often faced by daily travelers like students, professionals, and senior citizens.

With features such as accurate bus schedules, detailed in-between stops, fare information, and optional driver/conductor details, the app empowers users to plan their journeys with confidence. Integration with Google Maps allows real-time tracking, and offline access ensures usability even without an internet connection. Find My Bus aims to make public transport more reliable, accessible, and efficient for everyone.
